            "project_description_long": "The video project I recently worked on was an emotionally charged short film exploring the impact of mental health struggles on individuals and their families. Titled Broken, the film followed the journey of a young woman named Emma, who struggles with depression and anxiety in the wake of a traumatic event. As the Director of Photography, my role was to capture the visuals that brought the story to life.We chose a muted color palette to reflect the somber mood of the film, with occasional pops of bright color to represent moments of hope and resilience.We used natural lighting whenever possible, which helped to create an intimate and organic feel to the visuals. Throughout the film, we used a variety of camera techniques to convey different emotions and perspectives.For example, we used handheld cameras to create a sense of instability and chaos during moments of high stress and tension, while steady and controlled shots were used during moments of introspection and reflection.We also utilized creative framing and camera angles to highlight the characters ' emotions and to convey a sense of unease and discomfort. One of the most challenging and rewarding aspects of this project was working closely with the actors to capture their performances in a way that felt authentic and compelling.We used long takes and continuous shots to allow the actors to fully immerse themselves in their roles and to create a sense of intimacy and vulnerability in their performances. Overall, Broken was a deeply personal and impactful project that allowed us to explore important issues surrounding mental health and the human experience.It was an honor to be a part of such a powerful and moving film, and I am grateful for the opportunity to have contributed to its visual storytelling.",
